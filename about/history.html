        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, my name is Marjorie M. Anito, but you can call me Marj because everyone calls me that except for a few of my relatives. I've been alive on this planet since 2003, and I'm already 19 years old. Going to be 20 on May 29, 2023. In Meycauayan, Bulacan, I live with my uncle, aunt, and older sister, as well as some of my uncle's relatives. But right now, I'm living in Larlin Village with three other classmates. I'm staying here because of my studies, and if you're wondering where I study, I'm a 2nd year Associate in Computer Technology or ACT 2 student at La Verdad Christian College. I've been studying as a Technical-Vocational Strand or TechVoc, which is ICT, in La Verdad since 2018 up until 2020.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am grateful that I passed the entrance examination during my years in La Verdad. When the day came for my interview, I was disappointed to learn that the interviewer did not consider me a full scholar student because my older sister is still a college student there and she is a full scholar, because according to La Verdad's rules, only one child will be considered a Full Scholar and the rest of his/her siblings who will enroll there will be considered a Partial. But that's okay; at the very least, I passed the exam, and I'll continue my journey by studying here in La Verdad, which was built by Brother Eli Soriano and Kuya Daniel Razon as President, along with members of the Church of God International.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am the youngest in my family, with only one older sister. Her name is Michaella Magluyan, and she is an alumni here in La Verdad as well as one of the AIM Officers in ICT Majors as the Finance Committee Head. After she graduated, there was an announcement that there would be an election for AIM Officers, and I am eager to participate in our class as a Finance Committee Head because I admire my older sister's work as a Committee Head. Unfortunately, I did not win the election. If God allows, I will continue my studies in La Verdad, but as a third-year Bachelor of Science in Information System student, I am willing to run again for Finance Committee Head or AIM Officer.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My parents were not here with us,  but they continued to support us financially for our education.  My mother has been in another country since I was a child, and it's very sad that I haven't seen her in almost 11 years. Because of some issues in her country, we were doing video calls at a rare moment. And my father is in Zamboanga with his family. After many years, I finally saw my own father because there was statement that he would travel to Valenzuela with his brother and take the opportunity to meet us both with my sister.<br>
